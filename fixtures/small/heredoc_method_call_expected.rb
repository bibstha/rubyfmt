      According to Brueghel
      when Icarus fell
      it was spring

      a farmer was ploughing
      his field
      the whole pageantry

      of the year was
      awake tingling
      with itself

      sweating in the sun
      that melted
      the wings' wax

      unsignificantly
      off the coast
      there was

      a splash quite unnoticed
      this was
      Icarus drowning
