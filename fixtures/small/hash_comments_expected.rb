  # The rain has finallyt stopped;
  # now just a thin stream trickles from the root.
  all_night_the_incessant: "cry of insects",
  # Wide awake, unable to sleep
  leaning_on_my_pillow: "I watch the pure bright rays of sunshine"
  # O, that my priest's robe were wide enough
  # to gather up all the suffering people
  # In this floating world.
